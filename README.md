## Usage  
After installing, simply import it in your file. 

```javascript
const uiavatars = require("ui-avatars");
```

Consume the `generateAvatar()` API to get an avatar URL that you can use directly as an image. Supply the settings object to this method to generate the avatar image URL accordingly. You can either supply one or all settings, based on your requirement. All settings are pretty self-explanatory.  

```javascript
var avatarURL = uiavatars.generateAvatar({
            uppercase: true,
            name: "Tony Stark",
            background: "990000",
            color: "000000",
            fontsize: 0.5,
            bold: true,
            length: 2,
            rounded: true,
            size: 250
        }); 
```
